üëãüèª Hi, I‚Äôm Nathan, a technical professional from the UK with a passion for exploring the evolving world of technology. My areas of interest include **AI**, **Automation**, **System Administration**, **Cloud Computing**, and **DevOps**.

## Why This Blog?

I created this blog to document my journey through the ever-changing landscape of technology and to share what I learn along the way. Here, you‚Äôll find guides, tutorials, insights, and recommendations across a wide range of technical subjects that I am actively exploring, including:

- **AI** ‚Äì Delving into Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, and more.
- **Automation** ‚Äì Creating and sharing scripts and automations using various tools.
- **System Administration** ‚Äì Tips and tricks for managing Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
- **Cloud Computing** ‚Äì Insights and experiments with Azure Services.
- **Software & Tools** ‚Äì Discovering and sharing new software, tools, and utilities.

This blog is not just a space for me to organise my technical knowledge but also a resource for others. Whether you‚Äôre seeking software recommendations, time-saving automations, AI developments, or Linux command guides, I hope you‚Äôll find something useful here.

## My Interests

Outside of the tech world, I have a passion for:

- **Football** ‚Äì Supporting Leicester City and following the beautiful game.
- **Photography** ‚Äì Capturing moments and exploring creative perspectives.
- **History** ‚Äì Delving into the past, particularly the 19th and 20th centuries.
- **Travel** ‚Äì Exploring new cultures and destinations around the world.
