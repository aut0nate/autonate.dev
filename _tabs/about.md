# Intro
üëãüèª Hello, I am Nathan, a technical professional from the UK. I have a deep passion for technology, especially **AI**, **Automation**, **System Administration**, **Cloud Service** and **DevOps**.

I have experience in working across multiple operating systems, including **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. My personal preference sees me alternate between **macOS** and **Linux** (my distro of choice is **Fedora**).

# Why This Blog?
I created this blog to share my journey through the ever-changing landscape of technology. On this blog, you will find recommendations, guides, tutorials and insights across a range of technical subjects I am learning about, such as:

- **AI** - Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, etc
- **Automation** - Creating and sharing Scripts and shortcuts leveraging various tools
- **System Administration** - Managing Linux, macOS and Windows Operating Systems
- **Cloud Computing** - Exploring Azure Services
- **Software / Tools** - Exploring and sharing new software and tools

This blog is not only a place for me to organise and document technical knowledge, but also to share what I've learned with others. Whether you're looking for software recommendations, useful automations, interesting developments in AI, or deep dives into Linux commands I hope you'll find something valuable here.

# My Interests
When I'm not diving into the latest tech developments, I enjoy:

- **Football**
