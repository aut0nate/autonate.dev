## Site Architecture

autonate.dev is built using **Jekyll**, a static site generator known for its simplicity and speed. The blog uses the **Chirpy theme**, a clean and modern Jekyll theme designed for personal blogs and documentation sites.

- **Theme**: [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter), forked from [cotes2020/chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy)
- **Hosting**: The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, making it easy to maintain and update.

If you're interested in building a similar site, you can start by forking the Chirpy Starter theme and deploying it with GitHub Pages.
