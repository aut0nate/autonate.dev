I’ve been diving deeper into Git recently, using it daily in my current role compared to just every other day in previous positions. While I’ve been comfortable with the core Git commands for a while, my current role has pushed me to explore more advanced Git concepts and techniques.

I thought it would be useful to compile this guide as a reference, both for myself and for anyone else looking to sharpen their Git skills.

## What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system, widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Git is essential for managing software development projects, providing tools to collaborate, track progress, and ensure the codebase's integrity.

## Why Use Git?

When developing software or working on any project involving code or text files, it’s common to need a history of your changes or even to revert to earlier versions. Git excels in version control, which allows you to:

- **Collaborate**: Multiple people can work on a project simultaneously.
- **Track Changes**: Every modification to your project files can be tracked.
- **Branching**: Developers can create independent branches of code to work on features separately.
- **Reverting**: If something goes wrong, Git allows you to revert to previous versions.

Git's power lies in its simplicity and flexibility, allowing both solo developers and teams to work more efficiently. Now, let's dive into some of the most commonly used Git commands.

## Git Cheatsheet

These are some of the core Git commands that you'll use frequently in your daily workflow.


```bash
# Get all available git commands
git help --all 

# Get help about a specific command
git help <command>

# Get current version of git
git --version

# Get configuration information about git
git config --list

# Configure a user name for commits
git config --global user.name "<name>"

# Configure an email address for commits
git config --global user.email "<emailaddress>"

# Configure the default branch
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Initialise local git repository
git init 

# Check status of current repository
git status

# Check status of current repository (compact)
git status --short

# Check the logs of all commits
git log

# Check the logs of all commits and returns the output on one line
git log --oneline

# Add file to the staging area
git add <file>

# Remove files from index
git rm <file>

# Renames files
git mv <oldfile> <newfile>

# Restore a file to its state at the last commit
git restore <file>

# Restore a file to a specific commit
git restore --source <commithash> <file>

# Restore a file to a specific commit based on the value at 'n'
git restore --source HEAD~n <file>

# Remove files from staging
git restore --staged <file>

# Commit changes to index
git commit -m "<message>"

# Commit changes to index without staging
git commit -a -m "<message>"

# Amend the last commit (this will open your commit editor to modify the commit message)
git commit --amend

# Amend the last commit and change the commit message directly
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# Amend the last commit and change the author details
git commit --amend --author"name <email>"

# Create a new branch
git branch <nameofbranch>

# Renames a branch if on the branch
git branch -m <newbranchname>

# Renames a branch from any branch
git branch -m <oldbranchname> <newbranchname>

# Deletes a branch
git branch -d <nameofbranch>

# Force deletes a branch without warning of pending merges
git branch -D <nameofbranch>

# Switches branch
git switch <nameofbranch>

# Creates and switches to a new branch
git switch -c <nameofbranch>

# Select a branch
git checkout <nameofbranch>

# Creates and switches to a new branch
git checkout -b <nameofbranch>

# Merge a branch
git merge <nameofbranch>

# Merge a branch with a message
git merge -m "<message>" <nameofbranch>

# Deletes the local and remote branch
git branch -d  --remote  <nameofbranch>

# Clone repository into a new directory
git clone <repositoryurl>

# Retrieves updates from the remote repository, updating references but not modifying the working directory or current branch.
git fetch

# Fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch, updating your working directory with the latest changes.
git pull
  
# Show remote repository URLs
git remote -v

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin <remoteurl>

# Remove remote repository
git remote remove origin

# Pushes a renamed branch to the remote repo
git push origin -u <newbranchname>

# Push local repository to remote repository
git push origin <nameofbranch>

# Push the local 'main' branch to the remote repository named 'origin'
# and set it as the upstream branch, establishing a link for future pushes and pulls
git push --set-upstream origin <nameofbranch>

# Deletes a branch on the remote repo
git push origin --delete <oldbranchname>

# Rebase the current branch on top of the specified branch
git rebase <branch>

# Start an interactive rebase for the last n commits
git rebase -i HEAD~n

# Rebase your feature branch onto the tip of the master branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master

# Reset the current HEAD to the specified commit, keeping all changes in the staging area
git reset --soft <commit-hash>

# Soft reset (moves HEAD to another commit, but keeps the index and working directory)
git reset --soft HEAD~n

# Mixed reset (default; moves HEAD and updates the index with the contents of the reset commit)
git reset --mixed HEAD~n

# Hard reset (moves HEAD and makes the index and working directory exactly match the reset commit)
git reset --hard HEAD~n
```
